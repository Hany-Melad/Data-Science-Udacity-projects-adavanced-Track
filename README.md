# bike sharing  Data Exploration

## Dataset
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, i tryed to answer this question 
### When are most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year?
### How long does the average trip take?
### Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?
I found that there was a strong relationship between trips durations and specifics hours in a day 
we can find that the best time the user need a bike is form 6 :11 at morning ,and form 15:20
also number of mens are greater then womens also custmer  is the most user type

Outside of the main variables of interest, we can find that 
Duration distributions appear to gradually increase and then gradually decrease approximately every 7 days
the max Duration values at dates (2019-02-17 ,2019-02-18 ,2019-02-19 )
almost all males is customer type also males is greater than female in size 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of at which time per aday the durtion is max 
I start by introducing the
duration distrbutions  , followed by plot distrbution of duration per each 3 hours intervals per a day


Afterwards, I introduce distrbution of durtion per a day then 
relation of each of the categorical variables one by one.which is the  relation between duration_sec vs [member_gender , user_type, start_day, day_hours ]



I use the box  plots of durations  and [member_gender , user_type, start_day, day_hours ]

then plot duration distrbution for ervey day with 3 hours per day
using point plot
